# map-stpauls
The beginnings of the Millville Atlas Project. This repository contains demos with Mapbox, Leaflet, and React I created to test out different mapping tools during my 2024 fellowship with St. Paul's School.

## admissions-clone
A demo of what "maps.sps.edu" could look like, with an embedded Mapbox map. The HTML/CSS is from the SPS Admissions page (https://www.sps.edu/admissions), and I wrote all the Mapbox code in app.js. The HTML elements overlaid on the map are added in index.html and updated throughout app.js.

To run it, just clone the repository and open index.html in a browser. Alternatively, since this is a Node.js project, you can run whatever variant of "npm start" works on your machine.
